# midiMA

## What does midiMA aim to be?

midiMA connects faders of midi devices to [MA2](https://www.malighting.com/) Software via their *WebRemote*.

## How to use

[Enable *WebRemote*](https://help2.malighting.com/Page/grandMA2/remote_control_web_remote/en/3.3) in your MA2 Software. Edit midiMA.json according to config.rs to provide login credentials, MA2 console IP address and midi device configuration.
This is a temporary solution and will be replaced by interactive commandline input generating the configuration.

## Work in progress

A lot of features are still missing. For more info refer to [Pull requests](https://github.com/pr-c/midiMA/pulls) and [Issues](https://github.com/pr-c/midiMA/issues).
